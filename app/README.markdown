Front-End Developer Excercise


This is a web application that shows the 7 baby steps to financial peace.

This is a Node app. CSS Grid is used for layout. 
All fonts are contained in project.
All assets were created by Ramsey Solutions.

Run:

npm install (installs dependencies)
npm start   (starts web server)

My Experience Doing This Exercise
==================================

I learned CSS Grid for this project. It turned out pretty well I think. I liked having a professionally annotated layout to work with. I included all the appropriate fonts in the project so there would not be any issues on other platforms. The hex values in the CSS file are right though. Maybe it was a browser issue.

I did this project on my Linux box using VS Code.
